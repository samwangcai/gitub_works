								<p class="b_t b_t1" style="font-size:11px;">
									The public loves design, but a tag with hundreds or even thousands of euro makes this passion a dream. 
									This is not only against consumer's interest but also a stop point for the designer and manufacturer. 
									The modern meaning of design was born with the booming of mass production technology; yet nowadays it 
									has retreated to serve only a few people. This kind of regression is against what we like to call 
									“Design Democracy”. Design is not a workshop bargain to please the few rich, but instead a public 
									service to the people. The consumer has the right to make the choice amongst well design products with 
									affordable prices; and in these terms, both the designer and the manufacturer have the responsibility 
									to provide this choice. It is these criteria that guide <b>PHAI Design</b> ever since it has been established . <br>
									We are a group of people devoted to design, sharing the desire that one day all our friends can share 
									our passion, letting design be a part of their life bringing them closer to a more convenient lifestyle, 
									small surprises and a mood of enjoyment. This is <b>PHAI Design's</b> belief, target and more over responsibility! <br>

								<p class="b_t b_t4" style="font-size:11px;">
									In <b>PHAI Design</b> we have always considered the protection of the environment to be our responsibility. 
									A set of household goods should not only make part of a user friendly home environment but also be 
									environmental friendly itself. In every step of the design process we always strictly follow the 3R 
									(Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) design principle, aiming at reducing the waste levels to zero. We mainly 
									use easy-to-recycle PE, PP and metal to produce our products. In packaging design we take our 
									research far enough to be able to remove all the unnecessary material, saving the cost both for 
									consumer and ourselves; standardized design helps reducing certain moulds and cut-boards; tear-off 
									label makes it convenient for the consumer to re-use the package; using recycled materials also 
									helps reducing emissions of carbon. In every step of the production, keeping in mind our love for 
									the planet, we do our best to maintain the balance between nature and man-made object. <br>
